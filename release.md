# Release Notes for the local-coding-assistant 

## Version 0.2.0 -Spring Shell CLI bridge, In Progress
- 2.1 [x] Add Spring Shell commands that wrap the agent (e.g., `/chat`, `/review`, `/edit`, `/search`) and stream responses.
- 2.2 [x] Support multiline input, conversation/session state, and optional system prompt overrides.
- 2.3 [x] Provide CLI flags for model/temperature/max tokens and persist last-used options per session.
- 2.4 [x] Add smoke tests for command wiring and basic flows.
- 2.5 [x] Implement a "slash command" for input. The Challenge: Pasting multiline code into a CLI is painful.
  - /paste: Enters a mode specifically for pasting large buffers without triggering execution on newlines.
  - /edit: Opens the user's default $EDITOR (vim/nano/code), lets them type the prompt there, and sends it to the agent upon save/close. This is infinitely better than typing prompts in the shell.

  - 1.1 [x] Refine `se.alipsa.lca.agent.CodingAssistantAgent` personas/prompts toward repo-aware coding assistance (beyond short snippets).
  - 1.2 [x] Ensure actions use injected `Ai` (controller currently passes null) and propagate model/temperature options from config.
  - 1.3 [x] Add guardrails for word counts and result formatting (code + review sections) with tests.
  - 1.4 [x] Document/validate parameters via properties (`snippetWordCount`, `reviewWordCount`, default model).
